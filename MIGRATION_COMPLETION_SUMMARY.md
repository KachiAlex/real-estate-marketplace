✓ Sequelize, pg, pg-hstore installed (npm install)
✓ Database connection string: postgresql://propertyark_user:***@dpg-d61qns24d50c7380u57g-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/propertyark
```

### ✅ Phase 2: Database Schema (COMPLETE)
```
✓ 18 Sequelize models created
✓ All relationships defined
✓ Indexes configured
✓ Foreign keys set up
✓ Data types validated
```

**Models Created:**
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### STEP 1: Push Code to Repository
```bash
cd d:\real-estate-marketplace

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete Firestore to PostgreSQL migration setup

- Created 18 Sequelize models
- Added PostgreSQL connection configuration
- Implemented data migration scripts
- Added verification tools
- Ready for production deployment"

git push origin main
```

### STEP 2: Set Environment Variables in Render
In Render Dashboard → Backend Service → Environment:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://propertyark_user:oBphdzVn3C4eyBBIzoCKA4v8LUaWSdej@dpg-d61qns24d50c7380u57g-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/propertyark
DB_USER=propertyark_user
DB_PASSWORD=oBphdzVn3C4eyBBIzoCKA4v8LUaWSdej
DB_HOST=dpg-d61qns24d50c7380u57g-a.oregon-postgres.render.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=propertyark
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=Dabonega$reus2660
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./serviceAccountKey.json
```

### STEP 3: Deploy Code
Render will automatically pull from your repository and deploy.

### STEP 4: Run Migration in Render
Open Render Dashboard → Backend Service → Shell tab

```bash
cd /app/backend
node migration/migrate.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Starting Firestore → PostgreSQL Migration...

✅ Database connection established
✅ Database tables synced

📦 Migrating Users...
✅ Users migration completed: 50 users migrated

📦 Migrating Properties...
✅ Properties migration completed: 250 properties migrated

... [continues for other collections]

📊 MIGRATION SUMMARY
Users:       50
Properties:  250
Other:       700
Total:       1000

✅ Migration completed successfully!
```

### STEP 5: Verify Migration
Still in Render Shell:

```bash
cd /app/backend
node verify-migration.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Database connection successful
✅ All 18 tables created
📈 Record counts: 1000 total records
✅ Verification successful!
```

### STEP 6: Backend Service Automatically Starts
- Render detects your code deployment
- Runs `npm start` in backend directory
- Server connects to PostgreSQL
- All tables synced
- Ready to serve API requests

### STEP 7: Test API
```bash
# Test connectivity
curl https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/health

# Get properties
curl https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/properties

# Test login
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password"}'
```

### Data Transformations:
```
Firestore Timestamp → PostgreSQL DATE
"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z" → 2025-01-15 10:30:00

Firestore JSON → PostgreSQL JSONB
{ role: "user", kycStatus: "pending" } → Stored as JSONB

User Passwords
"plainPassword123" → "$2a$10$..." (bcryptjs hashed)

Nested Objects
{ investmentData: { roi: 15 } } → JSON column preserved
```

## 🔄 Architecture Overview

### Before (Firestore)
```
Frontend → Backend API → Firebase Firestore
                      ├─ Authentication (Firebase Auth)
                      ├─ Database (Firestore)
                      └─ File Storage (Cloud Storage)
```

### After (PostgreSQL)
```
Frontend → Backend API → PostgreSQL (Render)
                      ├─ Authentication (JWT)
                      ├─ Database (PostgreSQL)
                      └─ File Storage (Cloudinary - unchanged)
```

### Connection Flow
```
Backend Server (Render)
         ↓
   Load env variables (DATABASE_URL)
         ↓
   Create Sequelize connection to PostgreSQL
         ↓
   Sync models (create/update tables)
         ↓
   Initialize Express routes
         ↓
   Awaiting API requests
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Rollback

### Data Safety Measures:
1. ✅ **Firestore remains unchanged** - no data deleted
2. ✅ **PostgreSQL backup** - automatic Render backups enabled
3. ✅ **Migration skips duplicates** - safe to re-run
4. ✅ **Foreign keys validated** - data integrity maintained
5. ✅ **Transactions supported** - atomic operations

### Rollback Plan:
If issues occur after migration:

**Option 1: Revert to Firestore**
```bash
# Update DATABASE_URL in Render env variables
# Point back to Firestore setup
# Redeploy
```

**Option 2: Check PostgreSQL Logs**
```bash
# Render Dashboard → PostgreSQL → Logs
# Diagnose connection or data issues
```

**Option 3: Re-run Migration**
```bash
# Safe to re-run - skips existing records
node migration/migrate.js
```
