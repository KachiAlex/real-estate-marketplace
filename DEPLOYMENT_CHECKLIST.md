## 🚨 ROLLBACK PLAN (If Problems Occur)

### If Migration Issues:
```bash
# Option 1: Re-run migration (safe, skips duplicates)
cd /app/backend
node migration/migrate.js

# Option 2: Reset and remigrate
# (In Render PostgreSQL dashboard, reset database)
# Then run migration again
```

### If Backend Issues:
```bash
# Revert to Firestore temporarily
# 1. Update DATABASE_URL in environment to point to Firestore
# 2. Click "Redeploy" in Render
# 3. Backend will use Firestore instead
```

### If Need to Check Logs:
```
Render Dashboard → Backend Service → Logs
Render Dashboard → PostgreSQL → Logs
```
