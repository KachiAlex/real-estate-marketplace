## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### `src/components/GlobalSearch.js`
Main search modal component with:
- Real-time search with debouncing
- Tab-based filtering
- Result display with formatting
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Keyboard event handling for ESC key

#### `src/hooks/useGlobalSearch.js`
Custom hook for managing global search state:
- `isSearchOpen`: Boolean state for modal visibility
- `openSearch()`: Function to open the search modal
- `closeSearch()`: Function to close the search modal
- `handleResultClick(type, item)`: Navigation handler for search results

### Context Methods

#### PropertyContext
- `searchProperties(query, filters)`: Enhanced method for client-side property search
  - Supports search by: title, description, location, address
  - Supports filters: minPrice, maxPrice, bedrooms, bathrooms, minArea, maxArea, features

#### InvestmentContext
- `searchInvestments(query, filters)`: New method for investment search
  - Supports search by: title, description, city, address, sponsor name
  - Supports filters: type, status, minAmount, maxAmount, minROI, maxROI, duration, location, riskLevel

### Integration

The global search is integrated into the header (`src/components/layout/Header.js`):
1. Search input in the header opens the global search modal
2. Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+K / Cmd+K) registered globally
3. Modal renders conditionally when `isSearchOpen` is true

## Usage

### For Users
1. Click the search bar in the header or press **Ctrl+K** / **Cmd+K**
2. Type your search query
3. Use tabs to filter by category (All, Properties, Investments, Users)
4. Click on any result to navigate to its detail page
5. Press **Esc** or click outside to close the search

### For Developers
To use the global search in a custom component:

```javascript
import { useGlobalSearch } from '../hooks/useGlobalSearch';

function MyComponent() {
  const { openSearch, isSearchOpen, closeSearch, handleResultClick } = useGlobalSearch();
  
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={openSearch}>Open Search</button>
      {isSearchOpen && (
        <GlobalSearch
          isOpen={isSearchOpen}
          onClose={closeSearch}
          onResultClick={handleResultClick}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```
