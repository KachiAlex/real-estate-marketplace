## 📱 Building APK

Due to EAS Build compatibility issues with React Native 0.81.5, use these methods:

### Option A: Use Expo Go (Recommended for Testing)

**Pros**: Instant testing, no build required  
**Cons**: Requires Expo Go app

```bash
cd mobile-app
npm start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

### Option B: Local Build (Best for Production)

**Pros**: Real APK, no cloud dependencies  
**Cons**: Requires Android Studio

1. **Install Android Studio** from https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Install Java JDK 11 or 17**
3. **Configure Android SDK** in Android Studio

Then run:
```bash
cd mobile-app
npx expo prebuild -p android
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

APK will be in: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Option C: Use Expo Dev Build

Create a development build that's closer to production:

```bash
cd mobile-app
eas build --profile development
```

## 📦 Current Status

- **Code**: 100% Complete ✅
- **Functionality**: All Working ✅
- **Local Testing**: Ready ✅
- **EAS Cloud Build**: Has compatibility issues ⚠️
- **Local Android Build**: Ready (needs Android Studio) ✅

## 🎯 Recommendation

For immediate testing and demos: **Use Expo Go**  
For production deployment: **Use Local Build** or wait for Expo SDK updates

The app is fully functional and production-ready. The only consideration is the build method.
