# Escrow Payment Flow Documentation

## Overview

The Naija Luxury Homes platform implements a comprehensive escrow payment system that ensures secure transactions between property buyers and vendors. The system uses Flutterwave as the payment gateway and includes automated dispute resolution and fund release mechanisms.

## Payment Flow Architecture

### 1. Payment Initiation
- Buyer selects a property and clicks "Buy with Escrow Protection"
- System creates an escrow transaction with 0.5% escrow fee
- Buyer is redirected to Flutterwave payment gateway
- Payment is processed and funds are held in escrow

### 2. Escrow Period (7 Days)
- Funds are held securely in Flutterwave escrow account
- Both buyer and vendor receive notifications
- Buyer has 7 days to confirm property possession
- Timer countdown is displayed in real-time

### 3. Confirmation Process
- Buyer can either:
  - **Confirm Property**: Funds are released to vendor
  - **File Dispute**: Admin review is triggered
- If no action is taken within 7 days, funds are automatically released to vendor

### 4. Dispute Resolution
- Admin reviews dispute with investigation notes
- Admin can either:
  - **Release to Vendor**: Dispute is invalid
  - **Refund to Buyer**: Dispute is valid
