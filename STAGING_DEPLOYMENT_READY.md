## How to Deploy (5 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Deploy Frontend (10 min)
```bash
# Choose ONE option:

# Option A: Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Option B: Vercel
vercel --prod

# Option C: Netlify
netlify deploy --prod

# Option D: Local test server
serve -s build
```

**Verify**: Visit staging URL → should load without 404s

### Step 2: Deploy Backend (10 min)
Deploy your code with these environment variables:
```
FRONTEND_URL = [YOUR_STAGING_URL]
EMAIL_FROM = noreply@propertyark.com
SENDGRID_API_KEY = [YOUR_KEY]
SOCKET_ORIGIN = https://[YOUR_STAGING_URL]
```

**Verify**: `curl https://[backend]/health` → returns `{ "status": "ok" }`

### Step 3: Setup Firestore (5 min)
1. Create collection: `cannedResponses`
2. Add 3 sample documents
3. Update security rules (copy from STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION.md Step 4)

**Verify**: Can read via API: `GET /api/admin/chat/canned-responses`

### Step 4: Run Tests (60 min)
Follow the 7-part test checklist in STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION.md:
1. Socket.IO real-time (5 min)
2. Canned responses CRUD (10 min)
3. Email notifications (10 min)
4. Chat history (10 min)
5. Rate limiting (10 min)
6. Auto-archive (10 min)
7. Performance (5 min)

**Document**: Fill in STAGING_MONITORING_DASHBOARD.md as you test

### Step 5: Get Approval (30 min)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Admin team reviews
- [ ] Admin approves
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

## Key Decision Points

### Before Staging Deploy
✅ **Check**: Is build folder ready?  
✅ **Check**: Are all 7 files committed?  
✅ **Check**: Does team have staging credentials?  

### Before Running Tests
✅ **Check**: Is staging frontend loading?  
✅ **Check**: Is staging backend online?  
✅ **Check**: Is Firestore connected?  

### Before Production Deploy
✅ **Check**: Do all staging tests pass?  
✅ **Check**: Does admin team approve?  
✅ **Check**: Are there NO critical issues?

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Socket.IO Not Connected**
```
Check: FRONTEND_URL in backend env
Check: CORS configuration in backend
Check: Browser console for errors (F12)
Fix: Restart backend, clear cache, reload
```

**Email Not Sending**
```
Check: SENDGRID_API_KEY is set
Check: EMAIL_FROM is valid
Check: Admin has notifications=true in Firestore
Fix: Verify API key in SendGrid dashboard
```

**Rate Limiting Broken**
```
Check: backend/server.js lines 372-405
Check: Rate limit values and window
Fix: Adjust parameters and redeploy
```

**Tests Failing**
```
See: STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION.md "If Failed" sections
Follow: Specific troubleshooting for each test
```
