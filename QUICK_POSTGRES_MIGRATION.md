## 📊 What This Does

Transfers all your Firestore data to PostgreSQL:
- ✅ **Users** (with password hashing)
- ✅ **Properties** (all listings)
- ✅ **Escrows, Investments, Mortgages**
- ✅ **Blog, Messages, Notifications**
- ✅ **17 other collections**

**Total**: ~1000+ records migrated automatically

User: propertyark_user
Password: oBphdzVn3C4eyBBIzoCKA4v8LUaWSdej
Database: propertyark
```

**Already configured in:**
- `backend/.env`
- `.env`

## ✅ Verify Migration Worked

```bash
# In Render Shell:
cd /app/backend
node verify-migration.js
```

Look for:
```
✅ Database connection successful
✅ All 18 tables created
📈 Total records: 1000+
✅ Verification successful!
```

## 🎯 Key Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/models/sequelize/*.js` | Database models (18 files) |
| `backend/migration/migrate.js` | Main migration script |
| `backend/verify-migration.js` | Verification tool |
| `backend/test-db-connection.js` | Connection tester |
| `backend/.env` | Database credentials |

---

## 🧪 Test After Migration

```bash
# Test API
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/properties

# Test user login
curl -X POST https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password"}'
```

---

## 🛑 If Something Goes Wrong

### Revert Temporarily
```bash
# Update DATABASE_URL to use Firestore instead
# (Firestore data remains intact)
```

### Re-run Migration
```bash
# Safe to run again - skips existing records
cd /app/backend
node migration/migrate.js
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# In Render Dashboard → Logs
# Look for connection and migration messages
```
