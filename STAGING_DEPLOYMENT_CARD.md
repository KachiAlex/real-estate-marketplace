## Firestore Setup

### Create Collection
```
Collection: cannedResponses
Documents: 3 samples (Payment Received, Inspection Scheduled, Document Missing)
```

### Security Rules
```javascript
match /cannedResponses/{doc=**} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
}
```

curl -X GET https://[backend]/api/admin/chat/canned-responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]"

# Expected: Array of canned responses
```

## Testing Checklist (Quick Version)

```
☐ Test 1: Socket.IO connects (Console should show "Socket connected")
☐ Test 2: Canned responses CRUD (Create, read, update, delete work)
☐ Test 3: Email notification (Send urgent chat, check email inbox)
☐ Test 4: Chat history (Create 2 chats, see history tab)
☐ Test 5: Rate limiting (Send 20 → OK, 21st → 429 error)
☐ Test 6: Auto-archive (Set old conversation, run archive function)
☐ Test 7: Performance (Page loads < 3 sec, API < 1 sec)
```
