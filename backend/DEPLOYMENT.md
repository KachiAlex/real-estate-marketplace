CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key

## Testing Your Deployed API

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

### Health Check
```
GET https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/health
```

### Properties
```
GET https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/properties
```

### Authentication
```
POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/auth/register
POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/auth/login
```

## Updating Your App

To update your deployed app:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update backend"
railway up
```

## Connecting Frontend

Update your frontend API base URL to point to your Railway deployment:

```javascript
// In your frontend config
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-app-name.railway.app/api';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
2. **App crashes**: Check logs with `railway logs`
3. **Environment variables**: Ensure all required vars are set in Railway dashboard

### Useful Commands:
```bash
railway logs          # View application logs
railway status        # Check deployment status
railway open          # Open your app in browser
railway variables     # Manage environment variables
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Database**: Connect MongoDB Atlas or Railway's PostgreSQL
2. **Add Domain**: Configure custom domain in Railway
3. **Add Monitoring**: Set up alerts and monitoring
4. **Scale**: Upgrade plan as needed

Your API will be available at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
